# Investigation

1. **Issue**: Duplicate `return Response` statements in the post method: In the post method, you have two `return Response` statements, which is problematic. The first one returns a success response with a `201` status code after saving the data, and the second one is unreachable due to the presence of the first return statement. If there are errors in the serializer data, This should be handled and return an appropriate response. **Fix**: Check if `serializer` is valid. if true then `return Response` with `201` status code. if false then `return Response` with `400` status code.

2. **Issue**: No error handling for `Item.objects.get`: In the get method, you're trying to retrieve an Item object by its id using `Item.objects.get(id=item_id)`. If the item with the provided `item_id` does not exist, this code will raise a `Item.DoesNotExist` exception. This should be handled this exception and return an appropriate error response, such as a 404 status code, if the item is not found.
**Fix**: Added an `except` block and `raise` NotFound exception

## Other Notices

The project is not properly structured and does not follow proper practice. So I have separated every components to it's own file. These are `models.py` `serializers.py` `views.py` `tests.py`. This promotes code readability and reusability. It also follows the DRY Concept (Do not Repeat Yourself).
